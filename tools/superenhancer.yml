  Super Enhancer Workflow
    Usage: python ROSE_main.py [options...] [in.bam]
    Options: 
       -g STRING  REFERENCE GENOME BUILD UCSC FILE: one of hg18, hg19, mm8, mm9, mm10 file for example hg18_refseq.ucsc
       -i FILE    INPUT GFF file: .gff file of regions that contains the enhancers
       -r FILE    RANKING BAM: .bam file used for ranking enhancers which is sorted and indexed
       -o STRING  OUTPUT DIRECTORY: directory to store output
       -s INT     STITCHING DISTANCE: max distance between two regios to stitch together. (Default: 12500)
       -t INT     TSS EXCLUSION ZONE: excludes regios contained within +/- this distance from TSS in order to account for promoter bias (Default: 0, recommended: 2500)
       -c FILE    CONTROL_BAM: .bam file used as control. Subtracted from the density of the ranking_Bam
